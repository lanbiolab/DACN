DACN is a method that used to analysis spatial transcriptomic with varying resolutions and throughputs. 
DACN is implemented using Python 3.9 and R 4.3. We use the PyTorch framework together with the Scanpy and Anndata packages for bioinformatics analysis. 

#Note: DACN is developed based on the Windows system. The configuration methods for the rpy2 package differ between Linux and Windows systems.
The rpy2 package enables interaction between Python and R, and the Mclust package in R is used for clustering.

#Note：It is recommended to execute DACN within a conda virtual environment.
